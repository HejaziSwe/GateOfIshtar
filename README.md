# Background
We are developing an action/roll-playing game which is happening in the ancient babylonian time. One important object in this fantasy world is “*The Gate Of Ishtar*”. Different champions in the game should occasionally pass through the gate and meet with the “*council of wise*”.
<br>
Simple enough! But be aware that sometimes there are ancient gods and demons who guard the gate and they can hurt our champions that dare to pass the gate.
<br>
Below you can find the requirement draft:
* The amount of health (HP) a champion may lose varies between 7 and 25 HP depending on the time of the day (different god and demon forces are appearing during the day).
* “*Brand*” the god of fire and “*Mithra*” goddess of the sun have the highest damage and a champion will lose more HP when they are guarding!
* Champion should only lose HP once every hour
* Some Magical champions (e.g. Wizards, Spirits) are able to deceive the guards and pass through the gate without losing any HP
* Tuesdays and Thursdays are holly days in ancient babylon, so neither gods nor demons roam around the Gate. Our champions are safe from harm on the holly days.
* Champions initial health are:
  * Human 100
  * Wizard 100
  * Spirit 100
  * Giant 150
  * Vampire 110
